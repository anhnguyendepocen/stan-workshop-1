# stan-workshop
Examples of working and non-working models, initially for ODCS 2016 in Boston.

To make the best use of your time at the workshop, please look over the scripts in this repo and:

## Install Stan
Installing Stan is straightforward. Installation instructions are interface language and platform specific and can be found [here](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/). Our examples will be done using R, but you should be able to follow along if you are using other languages like Python or Julia.

## Download a Copy of the Stan Manual
[Stan manual](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/releases/download/v2.9.0/stan-reference-2.9.0.pdf) is full of usefull information and is part Bayesian textbook, part language reference. In particular, take a look at Section 3, Page 34 -- Data Types.

* [Chapters 1 and 12](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/rethinking/Statistical_Rethinking_sample.pdf) of Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking book.
